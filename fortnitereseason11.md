# Fortnite: Battle Royale Chapter 2, Season 1 Reference Guide

## Dates

* Release: Monday October 14th, 2019

## Experience

Experience and score has now been reworked. There are still remenants of the old scoring system.

It takes 80,000 XP to increase the Battle Pass by one level.

You can get XP by simply playing through the game and doing well (high placement, high damage, high eliminations).

Certain interative actions also earn you XP.

Supercharging works similar to the Rest system in MMORPGs (like World of Warcraft). To Supercharge the bar - Don't Play Fortnite: BR. It's that simple. While not playing Fortnite BR you gain a supercharge state depending on how long you have been away. There is a maximum that can be stored. When you play the game, your XP bar will turn yellow, show "XP SUPERCHARGED" and you will see a little lightning bolt on the bar. Until that point all XP you earn is (up to) quadrupled and will slowly consume the supercharge state.

You have a bonus to your gained XP if you purchased the Season 10 Battle Pass months ago.

Completing medals for the punchcard allows you to earn 24,000 XP a day.

## Arena Queue Scoring<a name="arenaa"></a>

At the start of Season 1 every player has been reset to 0 hype

### Division Prerequisite

| Hype Needed | Division | Name |
|------------:|----------|------|
| 0 | 1 | Open I |
| 500 | 2 | Open II |
| 1000 | 3 | Open III |
| 1500 | 4 | Open IV |
| 2000 | 5 | Contender I |
| 3000 | 6 | Contender II |
| 4500 | 7 | Contender III |
| 6500 | 8 | Champion I |
| 10000 | 9 | Champion II |
| 14000 | 10 | Champion III |

### Hype Scoring

*Duos have not currently been implemented*  
*Trios are not live currently*

| Solo Prerequisite | Duo Prerequisite | Trio Prerequisite | Squads Prerequisite | Hype Scored |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Victory | Victory | Victory | Victory | 60 |
| Top 5 | Top 3 | Top 2 | Top 2 | 30 |
| Top 15 | Top 7 | Top 4 | Top 3 | 30 |
| Top 25 | Top 12 | Top 8 | Top 6 | 60 |

* You score hype for all placings cumulative, so a Victory will always be 180 hype.

| Size | Hype for Elimination |
|-------|---------------------:|
| Solo | 20 |
| Duos | 10 |
| Trios | 7 |
| Squads | 5 |

### Bus Fare

Bus Fares have been standardised for Season X

| Division | Bus Fare Solo | Bus Fare Trios |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| 1-2 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | -10 | -10 |
| 4 | -20 | -20 |
| 5 | -40 | -40 |
| 6 | -40 | -40 |
| 7 | -50 | -50 |
| 8 | -60 | -60 |
| 9 | -70 | -70 |
| 10 | -80 | -80 |

### How hard is the grind?

Assuming a player could consistently score 80 Hype in every arena game, (equivalent to Top 25 and 1 elimination) how much games would that player need to progress to the next division?

| Progression to Division: | Games Needed |
|:------------------------:|-------------:|
| 2 | 7 |
| 3 | 7 |
| 4 | 8 |
| 5 | 9 |
| 6 | 25 |
| 7 | 38 |
| 8 | 67 |
| 9 | 175 |
| 10 | 400 |

This would take this player at least 12 games per day every day throughout the season.

## Fall Damage

You will start taking fall damage when dropping from a distance of at least 13 meters. The smallest amount of fall damage you will take is 10 damage. This scales up to be lethal at 23 meters. The damage is NOT linear.

| Height in meters | Height in tiles | Damage Taken |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 13 | 3.25 | 10 |
| 16 | 4 | 25 |
| 18 | 4.5 | 40 |
| 20 | 5 | 60 |
| 24 | 6 | 100 |
