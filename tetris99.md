 - A Double is when you clear two lines with a single dropped piece.
 - A Triple is when you clear three lines with a single dropped piece. This cannot be done with the Yellow O-Piece.
 - A Tetris is when you clear four lines with the blue I-Piece.
 - A T-spin Single is when you clear one line by spinning a purple T-piece into a place that it cannot be hard-dropped into.
 - T-spin Double is two lines, ajnd T-spin Triple is 3 lines.
 - A back-to-back is when you make a 'difficult' line clear without making an 'easy' line clear in between, regardless of how many pieces dropped in between them. Easy line clears are Singles, Doubles and Triple. Any Tetris or T-spin clear will trigger back-to-back. Back-to-backs can be chained one after the other but no extra lines are awarded for doing so.
 - A Combo is when you clear at least one line with each successive piece drop. The Combo counter starts at -1; if you clear at least one line, the combo counter increases by 1; if you do not clear a line with your piece it resets to -1. The Additional Garbage reward is added to your line clear reward immediately.
  - A Perfect Clear, or All-Clear is when you fully clear your board, like you have an empty board at the start of the game. It only adds +5 lines, but will always give a minimum of 5 lines.  
  -- For example if a single line all clear happens, you send 6 lines. If a Tetris all clear happens, you send 7 lines.
 - Badge points are awarded for KOs. You get 1 Badge Point for each KO plus any Badge Points collected by the player you KO'd. The Badge Points are represented by chevrons in the bottom right corner of your play area.
 - % UP increases the amount of garbage you send rounded down. For example if you make a Tetros with 25% UP you will send 5 lines instead of 4. If you make a back-to back T-spin Triple with 100% UP and 3 attackers on you, you will send 20 Lines.

Garbage is piled up when you are attacked. And is seen on the left side of the play area. If you fail to make a clear with your current piece those garbage lines will appear from the bottom of your play area. If you have Garbage laying in wait any attack you send cancels out the garbage in wait. For example if you have 3 blocks of garbage waiting, and then you make a Tetris, those 3 blocks of garbage will be cancelled out and one garbage is sent as an attack. If you are being attacked by more than one person at once you will have a longer grace period before garbage actually hits your play area.

You can increase the garbage you send if you are being attacked, and/or by collecting %UP.

There are 5 modes of attack in Tetris 99: Specific, Randoms, Badges, KOs, and Attackers.

 - Randoms will attack a Random alive player. This seems to be truly random but will more likely attack a player that aren't attacking you, aren't near KO and have few Badge points.
 - Badges will automatically attack players with high amounts of Badge points.
 - KOs will automatically attack players who are near being Knocked Out.
 - Specific targeting can be done with the left stick to target a specific player on the screen. You must choose the player. Note that you can choose dead people this way, but any garbage you send will be lost to the aether.
 - Attackers attacks all players attacking you. Any player attacking you will be shown with a yellow line from that player towards you. **This is the only mode where you can attack multiple people at once**.

The game speed of Tetris increases when there are:
 - 50 Remaining Players
 - 25 Remaining Players
 - 10 Remaining Players
 - 5 Remaining Players
 - You have 25% UP
 - You have 50% UP
 - You have 75% UP
 - You have 100% UP
 - If, in the past three minutes, one of the remaining player milestones hadn't been reached
