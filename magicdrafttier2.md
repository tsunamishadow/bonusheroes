## Pick 1 Tier

To put it simply, this tier is bombs, the best removal and Beast Whisperer. Couple of notes on these.

**Assassin's Trophy** is likely the best constructed card printed in this set, and it's efficiency and verstality makes it wonderfully sweet for limited too. If you're not taking it you better have a good reason why you aren't. **Beast Whisperer** isn't a bomb as such but making the majority of your deck amazingly better is a sweet card on its own. If you see any of these in Pack 1 Pick 3 or Pack 2 Pick 4 or later, you probably should consider switching and cutting off those colors hard.
