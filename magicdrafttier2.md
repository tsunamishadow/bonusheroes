## Pick 1 Tier

To put it simply, this tier is bombs, the best removal and Beast Whisperer. Couple of notes on these.

**Assassin's Trophy** is likely the best constructed card printed in this set, and it's efficiency and verstality makes it wonderfully sweet for limited too. If you're not taking it you better have a good reason why you aren't. **Beast Whisperer** isn't a bomb as such but making the majority of your deck amazingly better is a sweet card on its own. If you see any of these in Pack 1 Pick 3 or Pack 2 Pick 4 or later, you probably should consider switching and cutting off those colors hard.

## Pick 2 Tier

More bombs, but these ones require a little more work to get going rather than just being able to slam them down and suddenly be on the front foot.

Don't overpay for **Chamber Sentry**, it will only come in as as many colors as you put into it. A 2/2 for 2 mana that later *Shock*s is perfectly fine. Try and play **Lazav, the Multifarious** as late as possible, a 1/3 with surveil 1 isn't all that threatening, but if it suddenly turns into the best card you had that died (or surveiled into graveyard) it's going to be pretty nuts.

## Pick 3 Tier

Now we start going into semi-bombs and just generally sweet cards.

**Justice Strike** will immidiately kill a creature with deathtouch even if it's power is less than it's toughness. **Midnight Reaper**'s ability is not optional. And make sure you stack your Mentor triggers correctly, it checks as it resolves.

## Pick 4 Tier

Just genreally solid cards in almost any deck.

**Ritual of Soot** incredibly good card for both constructed and limited. Try not to pass this if you have the option.

## Pick 5 Tier

We start getting into the meat of what most decks will have.

All the **Guildgate**s are here solely for usefulness in this set. Value them highly especially if you are THAT guild. You might be able to splash another card off some off color guilds too. If you are using **Swarm Guildmage** for the menace ability, you have to use it before you get to the Declare Blockers step.
