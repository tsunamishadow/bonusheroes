# Nami's guide to Birmingham Major

## For international visitors

You can skip this section if you are native to the UK. Please note: absolutely NONE of this is legal advice. I'm not a lawyer.

### Emergency and safety

999 is the emergency number for the UK. The operator will ask you for a service you need which can be either Police, Fire, Ambulance or Coastguard. If you are not sure you can say you are not sure, but if you’re in doubt and need help immediately, ask for the Police.
112 and 911 (only on modern cell/mobile phones) will redirect to 999.  
999 can be called from any phone (even locked phones) for no cost.  
If you have a UK phone you can text 999; however you need to register for this service in advance from the phone. Texts cost standard rate.
101 is the number for the non-emergency police.  
111 is the number for non-emergency health issues.  
Voice activated phones (such as Siri or Cortana) will immediately ring 999 if you say “Emergency”.

Firstly note that the UK is under a “high threat” of international terrorism. However a terrorist attack is incredibly unlikely during this weekend. Simply remaining vigilant enough should suffice (i.e. Be sober while outside your home/residence).

On the whole England is quite safe, but it’s wise to not do anything dangerous or risky.

### Laws

Drug use is highly banned across the U.K. so I would recommend avoiding it entirely while you are here. Citizens aren’t likely to report drug use, but security and Police aren’t so kind.  
This includes: Marijuana, Cocaine, Ecstasy, LSD, Meth, Mushrooms, and Khat.  
Medicinal Marijuana is not legal here. Any amphetamines that you need to take with you must be kept within the bottle or container where its from.

Weapons are very strictly prohibited. You may not carry anything where it’s intent is to be used as a weapon. This includes firearms, blades and sprays. “Self defence” is not an excuse here. If, for example, you are in cosplay and are carrying a toy weapon (such as a foam staff) that’s okay since it’s costume. Carrying a full sword out on show and not in costume will raise suspicion. Yes, carrying standard mace/pepper spray is ILLEGAL no matter how many women do it. There is a legal but very specific spray called Farb Gel. This is the only carryable spray that is legal.   

There is a challenge 25 rule in place, which means that if you are lucky enough to look under 25 in places where they sell alcohol, lottery, knives or any movie or game with an 18 certification and you are buying any of them you will be required to show some basic ID to prove that you are at least 18. Any ID with a picture and a date of birth will do (such as a driving license). Your passport will also suffice but it is not wise to carry your passport around if you don’t need it.  

### Embassies

All of the Embassies are situated in London which is a city to the south of Birmingham and 2 hours by train at the least. However you should take the number and address of your embassy just in case. There are some smaller consulates located around Birmingham. They are:  

German Honorary Consulate  
Westwood Way  
Westwood Business Park  
Coventry  
CV4 8LG  

French Honorary Consulate  
1 Victoria Square, Office 310  
Birmingham  
B1 1BD  

Italian Honorary Consulate  
Science Park  
Holt Court South, Jennens Road  
Birmingham  

### Entering England/Border Control

When you arrive at the airport/seaport/trainport BEFORE you collect your baggage, you will be required to go through immigration control. You should have your required documentation (such as Passport and Visa) ready.
There are usually three lines:
* UK citizens
* EU, EEA, Switzerland citizens
* Everyone else (yes this includes USA)

Remove all items of clothing that obscure your full face, including any hats and sunglasses, you may still keep and wear glasses or earrings. If you are travelling as a family you will be required to travel together. When you are called to a Border Control officer you will be required to show your passport, visa documentation if you need one and if applicable any documentation about where you are staying (you may not need the latter, but it’s advisable you keep it on you). Most of the time the officer will expect you to speak decent English without needing an interpreter. I will also advise you carry one contact number on you (such as your place of stay) just in case things go weird or wrong. You may be allowed to contact someone, but you should definitely clear this with the officer before you make a call.  
In cases for British or European travellers and you have a ePassport (which has the ePassport symbol) and you are over 18, you may use the electronic gates instead. The attendant(s) there will give you instructions on what to do in this case.  
If you are from anywhere else you are required to fill in a UK Landing card and answer why you are coming to the UK. Don’t lie, they will ask for proof sometimes (and almost always if you say “to study”). If you can’t think of anything say “I’m here to visit friends.”. They may ask for proof about where you are staying and how long for a hotel reservation or similar should suffice. You must also have one blank passport page.  
If you are a Registered Traveller you can use the UK or EU lines and the Electronic passport gates. You will know if you are a registered traveller and know what to do in this case. If you aren’t (or more likely don’t know what I am talking about) you will have to line up with everyone else.  
If for some reason you are carrying more than €10,000, £6,750 or equivalent in cash you MUST declare it. You’ll have to fill in a form before you proceed.  
You must also declare anything over your duty-free allowance, any restricted goods, or anything you plan to sell. 

### Customs

The “Full English” breakfast contains Sausages, Eggs, Baked Beans, Hash Browns, Toast, Bacon, Black/Blood Pudding and sometimes chips (fries to Americans). Many cafés, hotels and restaurants that do breakfast service offer something similar. 

Most places will not automatically give you water or bread to start, you will have to ask for it. Some of the higher end places or fast food require to pay for water, though some pubs and bars might give you a glass of tap water for no cost. All licensened distributors of alcohol are required to give you free tap water if you ask for it, but they may charge you for the glass. If you ask for ice you will generally only get a few ice cubes in a glass rather than a bucket. Refills are rare and you are expected to pay for another drink.

Not all establishments work the same way, some do not have waitstaff and require you to order at the counter. Pubs and bars are not the same thing. Bars generally only serve drinks and are fairly small, pubs may serve food and can range from small to large. Waitstaff will not clear an empty plate or table unless you ask or you put your utensils flat in the middle of the plate. Tipping is not required or mandatory at all, but the custom is usually 10% of the bill. Do note that some restaurants add a service charge to the bill which they should warn you about before you pay, some of these service charges are mandatory and if they are they should say so before you order, but otherwise this charge is optional. If you don’t want to pay it (or that much) you should be prepared to say why and expect to be persuaded in paying it. If you can, try to leave your tips in cash as it allows the waitstaff to pocket it for themselves rather than having to give it to the sometimes unscrupulous owner. Tax is always included in the price at any food establishment.

There isn’t much racism and sexism in England but they do exist. Almost all of it is institutional and bigoted violence is so rare that you are just as likely to win the lottery. Quite greatly, if you shout something stupid like “KILL ALL BLACK WOMEN” or “GOD HATES GAYS” you are inviting random passers by to punch you in the face with much cheers to be had and police to turn a blind eye. England is a proudly inclusive country.

Prostitution is not illegal but solicitation (PUBLICLY offering sex for money) is. I would advise you to stay away. The age of consent is 16 across the UK. Sex offences are treated harshly, and if you are in any doubt, don’t try. Many places sell condoms including supermarkets, bathrooms and corner-shops. Morning after pills (leveonelle or ellaOne) can be bought from local pharmacies, but you must be 16 to purchase them. No sexual orientation is a crime or looked down upon, but there are judgemental arseholes dotted around.

Queueing is a strict pastime with a quiet code. Do not push or barge, don’t cut in and don’t be loud. It’s possible that if you need to leave the line for some reason  and come back and return but it’s custom to ask the person behind you before you do so and they are under no obligation to say yes; start again from the back. If someone does cut in line in front of you, don’t be afraid to loudly complain, you’ll probably have the support of locals and people behind you. In bars and pubs people crowd around instead but there is a ‘line’ and you are expected to wait for everybody that was there before you. Most barmen and women usually follow this line but if they don’t it’s custom to let people go before you if they were there before you.

When on escalators or travelators, stand on the right and walk on the left. Move any bags and luggage out the way of the left side. Some people will angrily ask you to move if you don’t stand on the right while others wont hesitate to push you.

### Travelling

InterRail, Eurail and BritRail are passes that can be bought by non-UK citizens and allow you to travel on the rail lines for free or for cheaper cost. However these passes must be purchased in advance and collected before you leave for the UK. These passes have restrictions and none of these passes apply to the Eurostar or London Underground trains. Do note that these passes are rather expensive, and personally I don't know how they work, though you are welcome to ask one of the staff in a Train Station for help.

When travelling by rail, ticket inspectors usually show up asking for proof of your ticket. It is an offence to travel without a valid ticket and they will fine you. Keep your ticket safe on you, they are patient and will wait for you to find the ticket if necessary. If your ticket is an e-ticket they will also accept that, but they usually scan the phone or device for it.

### Other things

You will almost certainly need a socket converter as the UK uses the three-pin-plug. The current is 240V and most electronics and devices will work through a converter, but some wont. Almost all phone and laptop chargers will work and even if they don't there are plenty of shops around that sell workable cables that can be used here.

Some people may be bewildered by the two taps (faucets) at some sinks, even though they may have only one spout. One tap pours hot water and another for cold. Some modern sinks have mixer taps but most in the UK don’t. All tap water is legally required to be drinkable unless there is a BIG AFFIXED SIGN NEARBY saying that it isn’t.

## For everyone

Cigarettes and E-cigarettes are widely available at most shops. However Arena Birmigham is partially non smoking. There are designated smoking areas, but usually only E-cigarettes are permitted in these areas.  

**Arena Birmingham is cashless**, and does not take cash at any of its stores or outlets, except for parking and merchandise. Your card will need to be "Chip and PIN" or at least "Chip and Signature" for it to work. They also accept ApplePay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay. There is a £30 limit if you are paying via contactless. They also accept most prepaid cards. Most of the retailers and outlets do not accept American Express cards. Nowhere accepts cheques. There is a cash machine on the concourse, but this charges you per transaction.  

### Food

Birmingham has an incredible variety of foods that range from the cheap to the very over expensive.

The Arena itself has a large variety on its own, these include:
- Fish and chips
- Classic Burger Kitchen
- Theo’s Street Good (Middle Eastern)
- NEO Pizza
- Amstel Bar (serves all kinds of alcoholic drinks)
- Stowford Press (serves most kinds of alcoholic drinks but mostly cider)
- Ice Cream

Outside the Arena there are many restaurants and bars (mostly bars though). As for fast food/takeaway there is Subway, Gourmet Burger Kitchen and far too many Gregg’s. Many of these places are open till late night.

### Travelling and Getting around

Travelling on a Train is the most common way to get into Birmingham and to get around the UK. However Train fares are extortionate so it is better to book tickets in advance. This can be done through any of the Train companies or trainline.com.

There are generally three types of ticket:
* Advance, pre book a train ticket in advance. You must travel on that specific train and get off only at your specific destination. These tickets are generally the cheapest.
* Off-Peak, you may travel on any off-peak time train (between 9.30am and 4pm and between 7pm and 2am on Weekdays and all Weekend) within the route. You can get off anywhere along the route.
* Anytime, travel at anytime anywhere that the railway service provides. These tickets are expensive.

No ticket guarantees any seat unless you also have a seat reservation. These reservations can cost a little extra and are sometimes necessary on crowded trains and popular seats (like ones with tables or power points).

There are certain discounts available to groups of 3 or more people, children below 15 years, and those holding railcards. It’s best to check with the operator with what is available.

Coaches are an alternative to trains and also travel many times across all of the UK (but not between NI and Britain). Coaches are generally, but not always, cheaper than rail but are almost always longer journey time.

RULE #1 with Taxis, false taxis do operate discreetly around the UK. Legal taxis will have a taxi-license plate on the rear bumper, have the name of the local council and the driver’s taxi license should be displayed clearly within the car. This includes UBER taxis too (though they don’t have local council but must display that they are a taxi somewhere on the rear window or back of the car). Do not get in any car or vehicle that you don’t recognise and if you feel unsafe call the police.

Black cabs have a distinct shape and colour and can be hailed in the street but usually at Taxi ranks near bus and train stations. They can easily accommodate 5 adults but sometimes charge extra depending on length, nighttime, waiting and luggage. The Taxi sign on the top is illuminated when it is available. These are usually only worth it if you travel short distances (say less than 30 miles) with a group.

Minicabs and UBER can be booked in advance but are usually cheaper than black cabs and are usually good for longer journeys. While UBER is widely available it’s one of the most expensive ways of travelling in the UK so should only be considered as a last resort. Both of these are cheaper than Black cabs though.

### Expected weather

Thursday - Very high chance of rain. Low wind speed. High sunshine with little cloud coverage. Temperatures between 11 and 19.

Monday - Small chance of heavy rain for a short time. Notably windy. Cloudy with sun. Temperatures between 11 and 26.

### Useful apps

Airport app - For Gatwick and Heathrow airports, they have an official app that helps you navigate the airport and find your flight. These apps are free.

Network West Midlands - Helps you get around Birmingham and the West Midlands on public transport detailing which bus or train you should take to get to your destination. The app is free.

UBER - The standard UBER taxi app, the same app works all around the world so there’s no need to redownload a regional one. The app itself is free but requires a payment method on file to use. UBER will always charge the currency of the country you are travelling in, for this instance it will always charge in pounds. UBER is very expensive in the UK.

BBC iPlayer - BBC catchup and on demand tv service available in the UK. While it can also be accessed via a webpage the app itself is much faster. The app itself is free but requires a registered account and a tv license, however any email is fine, you can use B1 2AA as a postcode and you can lie about having a TV License. Note that this app may not work without a wi-fi connection and will definitely not operate outside the UK. There is a Radio version for radio programmes too.

Google Translate - No cheaper translator app, and the only one I’ve found that works offline. Great if English isn’t your first language. Has a surprising amount of features including being able to translate text in a pseudo VR mode, speech-to-text-to-speech and the ability to download a whole language to able to translate without a data connection.

British Radios - Allow you to access the radio via your phone’s internet connection with an amazing choice from all the BBC stations to an incredible variety of music stations. App is free and also works outside the UK. Forces advertisements but a single payment can turn them off.

Citymapper - Similar and wider than Network West Midlands. Is free and very widely used.

Maps/Google Maps - Having an interactive map on your phone will really help in finding certain places and navigating the area. Google Maps will even allow you to download parts of the map so you can use it offline.

ITV Hub/All 4 - Similar to BBC iPlayer but for different channels. While it doesn’t require registration or payment both will inundate you with advertising.

Tixr - If you bought your tickets through the E-ticket service, you can use Tixr to hold the E-ticket on your phone within the app. The app itself is free but requires you to log-in. It seems that this app likes to use data, send your location and drains your battery rather quickly, so I'd exercise some caution around it.
