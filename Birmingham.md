You can skip this section if you are native to the UK.

### Emergency and safety

999 is the emergency number for the UK. The operator will ask you for a service you need which can be either Police, Fire, Ambulance or Coastguard. If you are not sure you can say you are not sure, but if you’re in doubt and need help immediately, ask for the Police.
112 and 911 (only on modern cell/mobile phones) will redirect to 999.  
999 can be called from any phone (even locked phones) for no cost.  
If you have a UK phone you can text 999; however you need to register for this service in advance from the phone. Texts cost standard rate.
101 is the number for the non-emergency police.  
111 is the number for non-emergency health issues.  
Voice activated phones (such as Siri or Cortana) will immediately ring 999 if you say “Emergency”.

Firstly note that the UK is under a “high threat” of international terrorism. However a terrorist attack is incredibly unlikely during this weekend. Simply remaining vigilant enough should suffice (i.e. Be sober while outside your home/residence).

On the whole England is quite safe, but it’s wise to not do anything dangerous or risky.

### Laws

Drug use is highly banned across the U.K. so I would recommend avoiding it entirely while you are here. Citizens aren’t likely to report drug use, but security and Police aren’t so kind.  
This includes: Marijuana, Cocaine, Ecstasy, LSD, Meth, Mushrooms, and Khat.  
Medicinal Marijuana is not legal here. Any amphetamines that you need to take with you must be kept within the bottle or container where its from.

Weapons are very strictly prohibited. You may not carry anything where it’s intent is to be used as a weapon. This includes firearms, blades and sprays. “Self defence” is not an excuse here. If, for example, you are in cosplay and are carrying a toy weapon (such as a foam staff) that’s okay since it’s costume. Carrying a full sword out on show and not in costume will raise suspicion. Yes, carrying standard mace/pepper spray is ILLEGAL no matter how many women do it. There is a legal but very specific spray called Farb Gel. This is the only carryable spray that is legal.   

There is a challenge 25 rule in place, which means that if you are lucky enough to look under 25 in places where they sell alcohol, lottery, knives or any movie or game with an 18 certification and you are buying any of them you will be required to show some basic ID to prove that you are at least 18. Any ID with a picture and a date of birth will do (such as a driving license). Your passport will also suffice but it is not wise to carry your passport around if you don’t need it.  

### Embassies

All of the Embassies are situated in London which is a city to the south of Birmingham and 2 hours by train at the least. However you should take the number and address of your embassy just in case. There are some smaller consulates located around Birmingham. They are:  

German Honorary Consulate  
Westwood Way  
Westwood Business Park  
Coventry  
CV4 8LG  

French Honorary Consulate  
1 Victoria Square, Office 310  
Birmingham  
B1 1BD  

Italian Honorary Consulate  
Science Park  
Holt Court South, Jennens Road  
Birmingham  

### Entering England/Border Control

When you arrive at the airport/seaport/trainport BEFORE you collect your baggage, you will be required to go through immigration control. You should have your required documentation (such as Passport and Visa) ready.
There are usually three lines:
* UK citizens
* EU, EEA, Switzerland citizens
* Everyone else (yes this includes USA)

Remove all items of clothing that obscure your full face, including any hats and sunglasses, you may still keep and wear glasses or earrings. If you are travelling as a family you will be required to travel together. When you are called to a Border Control officer you will be required to show your passport, visa documentation if you need one 7and if applicable any documentation about where you are staying (you may not need the latter, but it’s advisable you keep it on you). Most of the time the officer will expect you to speak decent English without needing an interpreter. I will also advise you carry one contact number on you (such as your place of stay) just in case things go weird or wrong. You may be allowed to contact someone, but you should definitely clear this with the officer before you make a call.  
In cases for British or European travellers and you have a ePassport (which has the ePassport symbol) and you are over 18, you may use the electronic gates instead. The attendant(s) there will give you instructions on what to do in this case.  
If you are from anywhere else you are required to fill in a UK Landing card and answer why you are coming to the UK. Don’t lie, they will ask for proof sometimes (and almost always if you say “to study”). If you can’t think of anything say “I’m here to visit friends.”. They may ask for proof about where you are staying and how long for a hotel reservation or similar should suffice. You must also have one blank passport page.  
If you are a Registered Traveller you can use the UK or EU lines and the Electronic passport gates. You will know if you are a registered traveller and know what to do in this case. If you aren’t (or more likely don’t know what I am talking about) you will have to line up with everyone else.  
If for some reason you are carrying more than €10,000, £6,750 or equivalent in cash you MUST declare it. You’ll have to fill in a form before you proceed.  
You must also declare anything over your duty-free allowance, any restricted goods, or anything you plan to sell.
