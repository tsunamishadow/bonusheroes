# Dota 2 Experience Guide

Experience is a fundamental, yet considerably misunderstood resource in Dota 2. This page will explain how Experience in Dota 2 works.

## What does Experience do?

Experience is necessary for your hero in order for it to gain a Level. Each Level your hero gets increases its base attributes by a certain amount depending on the hero and sometimes allows you to spend skill points on your spells to learn them so you can use them in play, or to level them up, becoming more effective. Levels are necessary for your hero to become stronger in the game without buying items using gold.

Most heroes unlock the ability to 'buy' Talents, Spells and the Skill Points to actually 'buy' them according to this table:

| Hero Level | Unlocks |
|------:|-------------------------------------|
| 1 | Skill Point, Basic Spell Level 1 |
| 2 | Skill Point |
| 3 | Skill Point, Basic Spell Level 2 |
| 4 | Skill Point |
| 5 | Skill Point, Basic Spell Level 3 |
| 6 | Skill Point, Ultimate Spell Level 1 |
| 7 | Skill Point, Basic Spell Level 4 |
| 8 | Skill Point |
| 9 | Skill Point |
| 10 | Skill Point, Talent Level 1 |
| 11 | Skill Point |
| 12 | Skill Point, Ultimate Spell Level 2 |
| 13 | Skill Point |
| 14 | Skill Point |
| 15 | Skill Point, Talent Level 2 |
| 16 | Skill Point |
| 17 |  |
| 18 | Skill Point, Ultimate Spell Level 3 |
| 19 |  |
| 20 | Skill Point, Talent Level 3 |
| 21 |  |
| 22 |  |
| 23 |  |
| 24 |  |
| 25 | Skill Point, Talent Level 4 |

Invoker and Meepo are exceptions to this:  
Invoker gets a Skill Point at every level, has no Ultimate Spell to increase, and can level his basic abilities up to seven levels at every odd number level: Levels 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13.  
Meepo gets Skill Points like standard heroes, but his Ultimate Spell Level 1 is unlocked at Level 3 and Ultimate Spell Level 2 is unlocked at Level 10.  

Increased levels of Basic Spells, Ultimate Spells and Talents cannot be purchased without first purchasing the levels below it. For instance you cannot purchase the Talent Level 2, without first purchaing one of the Talent Level 1 choices.
