# Is the BattlePass worth it?

In short, it depends what YOU want out of it. This time there isn't a lot of content meaning that skipping the BattlePass means you're not missing out on much at all. Here's what's **completely exclusive** to Battle Pass owners:

- Mutation game mode
- Ranked Role queing
- The couriers
- The terrain
- Creep model change *(only one person your party needs this to work)*
- Lion item *(to be released in the future)*
- Meepo announcer *(to be released in the future)*
- Chat lines and sprays
- Arcana voting
- Ranked Challenge tokens
- Fantasy Dota
- In game visual effects

If nothing in this list is something you want to pay for, it would be wiser to not purchase this BattlePass. Almost everything that can be purchased later will be cheaper to buy through the secondary market later.

## Mutation

New Mutations at Midnight UTC

Current Mutations are

- Periodic Spellcast
-- Every minute a random spell will be cast on every alive hero.
- Fast Spells
-- All heroes have 50% Cooldown Reduction and +100% Mana Regen.
- Death Gold Drop
-- When a hero dies they drop a sack of unreliable gold to be picked up. The size of the bag is proportional to that hero's Net Worth at the time of death.

# Achievements
  
  What you have to do, and tips on how to do them. The number after the hyphen shows how many battle points you get for achieving it. 1000 points is one battle level.
  
  Complete 4 weekly challenges - 500 points  
  Complete 12 weekly challenges - 500   
  Complete 20 weekly challenges - 1000   
  
  Each account is given a different weekly challenge which you must accomplish within the time limit. Each weekly challenge alone gives 400 points.  
  
  Complete 10 daily hero challenges - 500  
  Complete 40 daily hero challenges - 500  
  Complete 75 daily hero challenges - 1000  
  
  Similar to weekly challenges, daily challenges appear for each account requiring you to win a single game with a specific hero on that day. Doing so gets you 100 points for that day. Bar All Random Deathmatch and Ability Draft, the mode shouldn't matter though I haven't confirmed it. There are 105 days until the end of TI, so completing 75 challenges will be a large feat.  
  
  Win a Wager - 1000 points  
  Win 6,000 points by wagering - 1000  
  Win 15,000 points by wagering - 2000  
  
  Consistently bet high on games you'll think you will win and then try to win them. You must bet before the horn sounds in your game.  
  
  Tip a player during a game. - 50  
  Tip 50 players - 1000  
  
  To tip a player, open the scoreboard in game and press the Tip button alongside that player. Tipping does not cost you any Battle Points this time around, but you only have a maximum of 10 per week and 3 per game.  
  
  Tips give 25 points to that player. 50 points instead if your battle pass is Level 92. 100 at Level 337. 200 at Level 1,505.
  
  Open 6 Treasure X - 1500  
  Open 12 Treasure X - 4500  
  
  One set of achievements for each of the three Immortal treasures. You need all 12 treasures to get the full set of Immortals, so you may need to buy levels in order to get them.  
  
  Earn 1000 Trivia Points - 250  
  Earn 5000 Trivia Points - 500  
  Earn 10000 Trivia Points - 1000  
  
  While queuing for a game you can play a Trivia game on the home screen. You get 100 Trivia Points for each question answered correctly, with a small bonus if the question was difficult. If you want to grind this I suggest trying to queue Captains Draft only on the India server, as no one ever plays CD there. You get 100 Trivia points for each question you get correct, and a bonus (equal to 1 point for each % under 50%) if the question was difficult.
  
  Gift a friend a Battle Pass and have them unwrap it - 2000  
  
This can be done before you purchase a Battle Pass. You can gift a battlepass to someone on your friends list, and they can gift one back to you for an easy two levels. You can also daisy chain this as many times but requires organisation. Alice gifts to Bob who gifts to Charlie who gifts to Dimitri who gifts to Alice.. etc. You can only unlock this achievement once, and either Battle Pass will do.

Successfully predict 5 Pro Circuit or TI winners - 100  
Predict 25 - 500  
Predict 50 - 1000  

No information as of yet, but this seems to be per game.  

Win 1 Mutation Game - 100  
Win 5 Mutation Games - 500  
Win 10 Mutation Games - 1000  

Queue Mutation games and win. You can do this more than once a day.

Explore 10 Cavern rooms - 500  
Explore 30 - 1000  
Explore 87 - 2500  

Note that the Cavern is unique to each account. You'll be given a Cavern hero which will block your path to the next room, winning a game with that hero (mode doesn't seem to matter) opens up that path to the next room. There are 29 rooms in each third-sector meaning that you need all 87 to get the last achievement.
