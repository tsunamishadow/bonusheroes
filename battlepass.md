## Mutation

New Mutations at Midnight UTC

Current Mutations are

- Teammate Resurrection.
-- When a teammate dies, they drop a tombstone. Channelling (Right click on the tombstone) a 10 second revival brings them back to the same spot with half health and mana.
- Super Runes.
-- Power Runes are now more powerful. For example, Haste allows free pathing as well.
- Random Lane Creeps.
-- Lane Creeps will be randomly replaced by any Neutral creep (this includes any Ancient Creep but excludes Skeletons). Spawnings of creeps are not mirrored or symmetrical. Siege Creeps will never be replaced.

Recommended Heroes:  
Chen: Can Persuade Creeps to fight for you without diving into Jungle  
Enchantress: Can Enchant creeps without diving into jungle.  
Riki: Can channel a ressurection without being revealed himself (Note: Enemy can see the resurrection)  
Chaos Knight: Fast movement speed and good with any rune.  
Sven: Natural cleave and Warcry allows easy waveclear early game.

# Achievements
  
  What you have to do, and tips on how to do them. The number after the hyphen shows how many battle points you get for achieving it. 1000 points is one battle level.
  
  Win a Wager - 1000 points  
  Win 6,000 points by wagering - 1000  
  Win 15,000 points by wagering - 2000  
  
  Consistently bet high on games you'll think you will win and then try to win them. You must bet before the horn sounds in your game.  
  
  Tip a player during a game. - 50  
  Tip 50 players - 1000  
  
  To tip a player, open the scoreboard in game and press the Tip button alongside that player. Tipping does not cost you any Battle Points this time around, but you only have a maximum of 10 per week and 3 per game.  
  
  Tips give 25 points to that player. 50 points instead if your battle pass is Level 92. 100 at Level 337. 200 at Level 1,505.
  
  Open 6 Treasure X - 1500  
  Open 12 Treasure X - 4500  
  
  One set of achievements for each of the three Immortal treasures. You need all 12 treasures to get the full set of Immortals, so you may need to buy levels in order to get them.  
  
  Earn 1000 Trivia Points - 250  
  Earn 5000 Trivia Points - 500  
  Earn 10000 Trivia Points - 1000  
  
  While queuing for a game you can play a Trivia game on the home screen. You get 100 Trivia Points for each question answered correctly, with a small bonus if the question was difficult. If you want to grind this I suggest trying to queue Captains Draft only on the India server, as no one ever plays CD there.
  
  Gift a friend a Battle Pass and have them unwrap it - 2000  
  
This can be done before you purchase a Battle Pass. You can gift a battlepass to someone on your friends list, and they can gift one back to you for an easy two levels. You can also daisy chain this as many times but requires organisation. Alice gifts to Bob who gifts to Charlie who gifts to Dimitri who gifts to Alice.. etc. You can only unlock this achievement once, and either Battle Pass will do.

Successfully predict 5 Pro Circuit or TI winners - 100  
Predict 25 - 500  
Predict 50 - 1000  

No information as of yet, but this seems to be per game.  

Win 1 Mutation Game - 100  
Win 5 Mutation Games - 500  
Win 10 Mutation Games - 1000  

Queue Mutation games and win. You can do this more than once a day.

Explore 10 Cavern rooms - 500  
Explore 30 - 1000  
Explore 87 - 2500  

Note that the Cavern is unique to each account. You'll be given a Cavern hero which will block your path to the next room, winning a game with that hero (mode doesn't seem to matter) opens up that path to the next room. There are 29 rooms in each third-sector meaning that you need all 87 to get the last achievement.
