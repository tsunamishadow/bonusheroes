## Explanation

Team Performance shows game win and loss record in total and against other teams. The rating is an overall performance based on Elo but is only based on this specific tournament. Most teams for this calculation start at 1200, so better than 1200 is better than average, lower than 1200 is worse than average.

Regional Strength is the winrates of teams from each region but excludes any matches between teams of the same region. For example, North Amerca's winrates can be scored based on the average winrate of Evil Geniuses and compLexity Gaming, but will exclude any match between EG and coL specifically.
