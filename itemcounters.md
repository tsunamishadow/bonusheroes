# Item Counters

## Pudge
### Tranquil Boots
This is a bit odd, but Tranquil boots offers two things that can annoy weak Pudges - Health Regeneration and Movement Speed. The health regen will help surviving through hooks, Rot and his ult, provided that the boots don't get cancelled (though they probably will). The Movespeed will also make it hard for Pudge to ever catch you making it easier to dodge hooks and just run away from him, since Pudge is slow.
### Health
Any form of straight health is good against Pudge. Pudge gets tanky off of killing and assisting (even if he dies for it), so making it harder to do so as fast as possible is a good thing and makes counterattacks against him a lot easier. Bracers, Heart of Tarrasque or anything built from a Vitality Booster (Aeon Disk, Spirit Vessel, Vanguard) should go up in value.
### Sange
Sange offers Status Resistance which is pretty good against Dismember which is a BKB piercing stun as it lowers the time he locks you down and Rot also slows less while doing so. If you're thinking about S&Y or S&K, value them higher, most Pudge's won't see it coming and won't be able to deal with the time value you get out of it.
### Spirit Vessel
Given Pudge's natural high strength, which gives him both health and health regen, the amount of damage a Spirit Vessel will do is a lot more to Pudge than it will be to others. Also can cancel Urn and Blink dagger on him and keeps him wary of Rot since Vessel can tick before Rot can for a kill secure.
