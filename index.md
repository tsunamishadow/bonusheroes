Bonus Heroes are available for All Pick, Ranked All Pick and Turbo. Selecting a bonus hero in these modes gives the hero a free unsellable Enchanted Mango at the start of the game; this Mango can be built into a Magic Wand, a Wand built this way cannot be sold for full price. Voluntarily randomming a hero also gives a hero a free unsellable Iron Branch; this Branch can be used to make a tree or built into an upgraded item, the upgraded item cannot be sold for full price.

These items are tied to the hero and not the player, so if a hero is swapped any items given this way will go towards the new player of that hero. There is an inconsistent bug that causes a hero to lose the Mango given this way if the player buys an item in strategy time and then swaps the hero. It isn't worth randomming a hero unless you can play all the availible bonus heroes (since you only get one branch for doing so).

If the bonus heroes do not update on the main menu hero tab, enter an online game (i.e. not a local bot game) and it will be fixed.

Bonus heroes change at 03:00 UTC every day, 7pm Seattle time.

There are 74,540,946,223,878 possible combinations of heroes for bonus hero selection (or indeed a single game of Dota).
