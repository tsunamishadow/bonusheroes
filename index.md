## [Jungle camp stack timing](https://i.redd.it/cektd9j3eb311.jpg)

A jpg which shows stack timings on the map. Made by /u/redfoxricky.

*These stacking requires no chopping down a tree or even boots, just make sure your attack lands on the creep at the timing.*

*The 2 dire medium camps are close to each other are suppose to be pulled to the triangle that is furthest apart from the camp.*

*All stacks was made with crystal maiden when getting these timestamps.*

*I made this because I couldn't find a image like this, which shows how to stack as many times and possible which is something I really was looking for, so I decided to do it myself and share it with the community.*

*While I was looking up the camps on "Neutral creeps" on Dota 2 Wiki, I saw that the 1 Radiant Medium camp and Hard camp are wrong, I don't care enough to make an account and change it, will point it out here in hopes one will.*
