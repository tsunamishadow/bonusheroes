## Arena Queue Scoring

At the start of Season X (10) every player has been reset to 0 hype

### Division Prerequisite

| Hype Needed | Division | Name |
|------------:|----------|------|
| 0 | 1 | Open I |
| 500 | 2 | Open II |
| 1000 | 3 | Open III |
| 1500 | 4 | Open IV |
| 2000 | 5 | Contender I |
| 3000 | 6 | Contender II |
| 4500 | 7 | Contender III |
| 6500 | 8 | Champion I |
| 10000 | 9 | Champion II |
| 14000 | 10 | Champion III |

### Hype Scoring

*Duos have not currently been implemented*

| Solo Prerequisite | Duo Prerequisite | Trio Prerequisite | Hype Scored |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Victory | Victory | Victory | 60 |
| Top 5 | Top 3 | Top 2 | 30 |
| Top 15 | Top 7 | Top 4 | 30 |
| Top 25 | Top 12 | Top 8 | 60 |

* You score hype for all placings cumulative, so a Victory will always be 180 hype.

| Size | Hype for Elimination |
|-------|---------------------:|
| Solo | 20 |
| Duos | 10 |
| Trios | 7 |

### Bus Fare

Bus Fares have been standardised for Season X

| Division | Bus Fare Solo | Bus Fare Trios |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| 1-2 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | -10 | -10 |
| 4 | -20 | -20 |
| 5 | -40 | -40 |
| 6 | -40 | -40 |
| 7 | -50 | -50 |
| 8 | -60 | -60 |
| 9 | -70 | -70 |
| 10 | -80 | -80 |

### How hard is the grind?

Assuming a player could consistently score 80 Hype in every arena game, (equivalent to Top 25 and 1 elimination) how much games would that player need to progress to the next division?

| Progression to Division: | Games Needed |
|:------------------------:|-------------:|
| 2 | 7 |
| 3 | 7 |
| 4 | 8 |
| 5 | 9 |
| 6 | 25 |
| 7 | 38 |
| 8 | 67 |
| 9 | 175 |
| 10 | 400 |

This would take this player at least 12 games per day every day throughout the season.
