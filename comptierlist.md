If you can't make head or tail of this list I made a simplified here: [Simplified List](/bonusheroes/simpletierlist)  
Skywrath Mage was never contested.  
Grimstroke is not availible in Captain's Mode.  

Hero: Name of Hero  
P+B: Number of times the Hero was Picked and Banned  
Pick: Number of times the Hero was Picked  
Ban: Number of times the Hero was Banned  
Win: Number of wins when the Hero was Picked  
Lose: Number of losses when the Hero was Picked  
Win%: Winrate of the hero when it was Picked  
Contest%: The rate that hero was contested (Picked or Banned) among all played matches, the most important stat to look at  
Decency: A rating calculated by confidence intervals. Essentially the answer to the question "What would be the lowest expected winrate of a hero if it was played infinitely?". Higher is better, favors heroes that are played more and then higher winrate.  
D*(2P+B): A competitive score based on Decency and Contest. (Higher is better, this is a comparitive score rather than an absolute one).  

Any number bolded, means that it is among the Top 10 in that category.
