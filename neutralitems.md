## Tier 1

### Keen Optic

* +75 Cast Range
* +1.25 Mana Regen

Expected Gold Value of item: 511.6r Gold

Keen Optic is basically a smaller Aether Lens that stacks on top of Aether Lens. However an overlooked fact is that most of the value from Keen Optic is the mana regen that can come early enough in the game for little gold cost, giving as much mana regen as a Basilius Ring. You should ideally give it to a hero that is mana starved since the cast range, while helpful is very small and will realistically only give you a 0.25sec advantage at best in a fight.

Good heroes: Vengeful Spirit, Ogre Magi, Lich, Bane, Omniknight, Shadow Shaman

<!--- 316.6r gold for 250 cast range, 95 gold for 75 cast range --->

### Poor Man's Shield

* +7 Agility
* Gives 100% **Damage Block** which blocks 30/20 damage from attacks if the holder is Melee/Ranged. Only has a 50% chance to proc against creeps.

Expected Gold Value of item: 525 Gold (not including Damage block)

One thing a lot of players forget is that Melee heroes now have an innate Damage Block as standard (a 50% chance to block 16 damage); so putting a Poor Man's Shield on a Melee hero simply overrides that innate benefit since the two don't stack vertically. The best team benefit then is on a ranged hero that gets close enough to use the Damage block as well as the Agility. In any case though the PMS is still good on Melee Agility heroes giving them a nice little boost to both fight and farm earlier in the game. After all, the innate Damage Block Melee heroes get goes from 50% to 75% against creeps.

Good heroes: Vengeful Spirit, Visage, Slark, Drow Ranger, Sniper, Mirana, Viper

### Iron Talon

* +15 Attack Speed
+ +2 Armor

Expected Gold Value of Item: 450 Gold (not including Active)

Iron Talon has a home in being able to Jungle faster against Larger camps (it cannot hit Ancients) and Siege Creeps. Ideally it's a nice farm recovery item when behind in map space allowing the user to farm just a little bit faster. One thing to bear in mind is the active can be amplified by Bloodseeker's Bloodrage (yes BOTH ways) and Beastmaster's Wild Axes (yes BOTH axes). It can also be quite useful in killing off player controlled creeps faster; such as Beastmaster's Boar, Invoker's Forged Spirit, Lycan's Wolves and Chen and Enchantress's Persuaded Creeps.

Good heroes: Bloodseeker, Beastmaster, Underlord, Anti-Mage, Dark Willow, Morphling, Windranger, Queen of Pain
