# Dota Pub Hero Tier List
This tier list is based on pub stats taken from Dotabuff, Opendota and Stratz. Most of this tier list is weighted toward Divine and Immortal with Crusader and lower winrates ignored.
Updated 1st July 2018, based on June performances.
## Powerful
Wins a considerable amount of games and can be easily Hero Spammed for MMR or wins. Very difficult to win against.
## Strong
Wins a lot of games. Hero specialists of these can easily gain wins and MMR, but most of the 'good hero' meta is made from these heroes.
## High Average
Wins more often than loses. But not enough to be strong, usually heroes here will get around 50% winrate. Can be good with or against strong or powerful heroes if they have good synergy or opposing matchup.
## Low Average
Wins just as often as they lose. Usually just lower than 50% winrate. Can be good with strong or powerful heroes if they have good synergy.
## Weak
Heroes that lose more often than win. Usually around 45% winrate.
## Underpowered
Heroes that lose a lot. Usually around 42% winrate. Almost always worth avoiding for anyone but hero specialists.
