# Dota Pub Hero Tier List
This tier list is based on pub stats taken from Dotabuff, Opendota and Stratz. Most of this tier list is weighted toward Divine and Immortal with Crusader and lower winrates ignored.  
This list is slightly influenced by competitive performances but is not useful for determining which heroes are strong for TI-level Dota.  
Updated 1st Septermber 2018, based on August performances during 7.19. Due to 7.19b, heroes here will be listed with either nerfed or buffed to give an indication of where they may expect to improve or fall off in effectiveness.  
Grimstroke is not listed due to being a new addition to the list of heroes.  
Lone Druid is not listed due to a lack of pick rate in pubs.  

## Powerful
Wins a considerable amount of games and can be easily Hero Spammed for MMR or wins. Very difficult to win against.
