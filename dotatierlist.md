# Dota Pub Hero Tier List
This tier list is based on pub stats taken from Dotabuff, Opendota and Stratz. Most of this tier list is weighted toward Divine and Immortal with Crusader and lower winrates ignored.  
This list is very slightly influenced by competitive performances but is not useful for determining which heroes are strong for TI-level Dota.  
Updated 2nd October 2018, based on Performances during 7.19c.

## Powerful
Wins a considerable amount of games and can be easily Hero Spammed for MMR or wins. Very difficult to win against.
