# The International Compedium Predictions Guide

Hello and welcome to another glorious guide to picking predictions. This year, I decided to forego getting the battle pass myself, which means I can delve a little deeper into the categories and give you more objective views for each category, and help you make a choice for yourself!

## Heroes
Reiterating the exact same as last year: TI has become more and more unpredictable with the hero meta becoming less and less similar to the hero meta in previous weeks before it. TI has its own meta especially when teams secretly scrim each other so much and exclude teams that didn't make it to TI. But most importantly, the Heroes that win these categories *are majorly influenced by teams that play more games*, that is to say, teams that do well.

### Most Picked Hero

The biggest candidate seems to be **Grimstroke**, largely due to how often it has been picked and banned by all the teams in question over the last couple of months. What's interesting though is that Grimstroke has recieved a set of consecutive nerfs, putting his more recent performances into question at professional level. His common pairings in Doom, Batrider and Juggernaut also look shaky. What's worse he's not valued nearly as much as other heroes. He seems to be the safe pick, but I don't think it's the correct one.

A common pickup by all the teams and the top teams here, as well as professional players across the board is **Rubick**. It's not difficult to see why. Rubick is a common versatile support hero with a powerful ultimate in Spell Steal that got more powerful now that everybody has an Aghanim's Scepter upgrade. He's able to work in greed lineups, push lineups, and stall lineups, and Arcane Supremacy is still showing its weight in fights and skirmishes. To top it off, Rubick last recieved a small buff and has not yet recieved a nerf despite his popularity.

Other good picks here are:
 - Warlock
 - Ember Spirit
 - Centaur Warrunner
 - Omniknight
 - Spirit Breaker
 - Shadow Shaman
 
### Most Banned Hero

Cultural collective wisdom seems to be to go with the hero that everybody seems to hate, lots seem to be scared of and what pro players seem to be annoyed by. The two biggest right now are **Sven** and **Chen**. Sven has a strong set of abilities that only get more threatening the longer the game goes, after all, if building Strength items gives both health and damage then shouldn't that be enough to be valuable? The changes to Warcry and God's Strength helped him as well. Chen is an outlier for amazing reasons. He's scary in the hands of a support and can straight win a laning stage, and that alone can secure games. His winrate is proof of that, being over 60% and is still incredible even with changes and nerfs recently-I know this first hand. Try him, he's insane.

Historically Io nears the top spot, and while he's expected to be banned a lot he's not expected to be picked that much. Changes to Tether and Talents have faulted the ball of lights early game power. He'll be a high ban, but he won't be the highest. *And I'll eat my shoe if that turns out to be true.*

Other good picks here are:

 - Dark Seer
 - Batrider
 - Enigma
 - Templar Assassin
 - Mars
 - Anything I mentioned in Most Picked Hero, but don't pick the same hero for both.
 
### Hero With Highest Win Rate

There are two schools of thought here: **Meepo** or a powerful hero that isn't popular. Meepo makes his mark here due to his considerable power right now, as well as a surprising amount of players at TI that can play him. Abed, w33, and MidOne all can demonstrate winning games when he's let through, and I'm certain a couple more midlaners have been practising him just in case. However knowing this, he's probably not expected to get through that much and banned often enough against those players he may not see enough play anyway.

As for the other school of thought, there are a couple candidates to choose:

 - Omniknight
 - Beastmaster
 - Bane
 - Pangolier
 - Dark Willow
 - Visage
 - Vengeful Spirit
 
### Hero with Highest Kill Average
 
Highest Kill Average is the number of kills the hero made divided by the number of games the hero played. The common safe pick here is **Clinkz**, being a hero who loves to hunt down for kills after all. But there are two problems. One, Clinkz is becoming and more and more popular among most of these teams, and usually the hero that wins this category, like the last, isn't picked a lot. You don't want the hero you pick here to have a bad game to ruin the average, or worse several bad games. Problem number two lies in that the top teams at this TI don't care for Clinkz at all. They prefer:

 - Leshrac
 - Sven
 - Ember Spirit
 - Templar Assassin
 - Death Prophet
 - Slark
 - Axe
 - Windranger
 
**Storm Spirit** and **Queen of Pain** are also good shouts if you don't expect them to be popular.

### Hero with Highest Assist Average

This, to many people's surprise is won by a support that usually loves to get into fights often and as early as possible, so usually roamers or moving supports. Once again, you want a hero that fits that role but isn't overly popular. Any of the following are good shouts:

- Warlock
- Rubick
- Tusk
- Omniknight
- Shadow Shaman
- Vengeful Spirit
- Spirit Breaker

I could see **Clockwerk** and **Earth Spirit** winning this too, but those heroes are a little unfavored right now to have that much of an impact, or play that much games.

### Hero with lowest Death Average

This is almost always a carry that enjoys being protected, rather than someone durable enough to survive. Common safe picks tend to say **Naga Siren**, **Medusa** or **Anti-Mage**.

My money (though I'm not risking anything really) is on **Slark**. He's not that popular, his winrate is average, but his low death count (usually averaging 2) is surprisingly low amongst the rest of the field.

If you don't want to choose from those, pick an unpopular carry hero that doesn't like being killed in order to win a game like these ones. *Don't pick a tanky hero like Centaur or Pudge, pros don't play those heroes to not die*. A hero with escapes also helps.

### Hero with highest last hits Average

- Tinker
- Naga Siren
- Anti-Mage
- Medusa
- Gyrocopter
- Lone Druid

It will almost certainly be one of these, the question which one do you think will be picked enough to pass the threshold, but not too much to lower the average?

**Lone Druid** is the random guess I'll make.

### Hero with the highest XPM Average

**Meepo**.

Unless you think that Meepo won't be picked enough to make the games or too much (like over 20) then it's almost certainly Meepo. The next closest heroes are **Anti-Mage** and then **Sven**. No other real candidates come close.

It is almost always a core that wins stats like this, and never a core that has an XPM talent.

### Hero with most Kills in a game

There was an interesting strategy that some of my friends did last year. Rather than try and guess (and this one is honestly just luck of the draw) they went through their games for the previous couple of months and found their hero that they got their highest kill record in that time frame. A respectable number chose Tiny and got it correct!

No amount of analysis is going to help, this is going to be won by a hero that pops-off in one game and that's it. The only thing I can assure is that it will be won by **a hero that is exclusively played as a core hero**. Don't go picking Crystal Maiden here. Other than that, choose what your heart desires.

My gun to head guess? **Lina**. Though the hero I got my most kills with was Windranger and Chen tied (at 23). *Don't look at me like that! It's not my fault creeps do insane damage!!*

### Hero with most last hits in a game

- Arc Warden
- Naga Siren
- Meepo
- Tinker
- Anti-Mage

This one is also luck of the draw. So pick one at random until your heart feels happy. This is almost always won by a midlaner or carry hero. Though weirdly the record I personally have this year for it is ... Axe. *Yeah that game did not go well.* 

## Teams

### Winner of The International 2019

This time around I did an extensive profile of all the teams in the competition to give you much of an informed choice. Click the link above to go to it. For a shorter analysis the favorites are:

- Team Secret
- Vici Gaming
- Virtus.pro
- PSG.LGD
- Team Liquid

If it's not one of those five prepare to defend your reasoning. Remember the team that wins:

- **ALWAYS start in the Upper Bracket**
- Almost always do very well in the group stage (at least 3rd in the group)
- Aren't always the most exciting team to watch throughout

### Team with most Kills in a game

As always with these categories, it's more luck of the draw than anything

The most realistic candidates are 

- Alliance
- Virtus.pro
- TNC Predator
- PSG.LGD
- OG

Take your hearts pick.
