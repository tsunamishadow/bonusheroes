# The International Compedium Predictions Guide

Hello and welcome to another glorious guide to picking predictions. This year, I decided to forego getting the battle pass myself, which means I can delve a little deeper into the categories and give you more objective views for each category, and help you make a choice for yourself!

## Heroes
Reiterating the exact same as last year: TI has become more and more unpredictable with the hero meta becoming less and less similar to the hero meta in previous weeks before it. TI has its own meta especially when teams secretly scrim each other so much and exclude teams that didn't make it to TI. But most importantly, the Heroes that win these categories *are majorly influenced by teams that play more games*, that is to say, teams that do well.

### Most Picked Hero

The biggest candidate seems to be **Grimstroke**, largely due to how often it has been picked and banned by all the teams in question over the last couple of months. What's interesting though is that Grimstroke has recieved a set of consecutive nerfs, putting his more recent performances into question at professional. His common pairings in Doom, Batrider and Juggernaut also look shaky. What's worse he's not valued nearly as much as other heroes. He seems to be the safe pick, but I don't think it's the correct one.

A common pickup by all the teams and the top teams here, as well as professional players across the board is **Rubick**. It's not difficult to see why. Rubick is a common versatile support hero with a powerful ultimate in Spell Steal that got more powerful now that everybody has an Aghanim's Scepter upgrade. He's able to work in greed lineups, push lineups, and stall lineups, and Arcane Supremacy is still showing its weight in fights and skirmished. To top it off, Rubick last recieved a small buff and has not yet recieved a nerf despite his popularity.

Other good picks here are:
 - Warlock
 - Ember Spirit
 - Centaur Warrunner
 - Omniknight
 - Spirit Breaker
 - Shadow Shaman
 
### Most Banned Hero

Cultural collective wisdom seems to be to go with the hero that everybody seems to hate, lots seem to be scared of and what pro players seem to be annoyed by. The two biggest right now are **Sven** and **Chen**. Sven has a strong set of abilities that only get more threatening the longer the game goes, after all, if building Strength items gives both health and damage then shouldn't that be enough to be valuable? The changes to Warcry and God's Strength helped him as well. Chen is an outlier for amazing reasons. He's scary in the hands of a support and can straight win a laning stage, and that alone can secure games. His winrate is proof of that, being over 60% and is still incredible even with changes and nerfs recently-I know this first hand.

Historically Io nears the top spot, and while he's expected to be banned a lot he's not expected to be picked that much. Changes to Tether and Talents have faulted the ball of lights early game power. He'll be a high ban, but he won't be the highest.

Other good picks here are:

 - Dark Seer
 - Batrider
 - Enigma
 - Templar Assassin
 - Mars
 - Anything I mentioned in Most Picked Hero, but don't pick the same hero for both.
