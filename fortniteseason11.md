## Dates

* Release: Monday October 14th, 2019
* Season End: Sunday December 8th, 2019 (unconfirmed)

## Experience<a name="xpa"></a>

Experience and score has now been reworked. There are still remenants of the old scoring system.

It takes 80,000 XP to increase the Battle Pass by one level.

You can get XP by simply playing through the game and doing well (high placement, high damage, high eliminations).

Certain interative actions also earn you XP.

Supercharging works similar to the Rest system in MMORPGs (like World of Warcraft). To Supercharge the bar - Don't Play Fortnite: BR. It's that simple. While not playing Fortnite BR you gain a supercharge state depending on how long you have been away. There is a maximum that can be stored, and a minimum time of not playing the game to gain the state. When you play the game, your XP bar will turn yellow, show "XP SUPERCHARGED" and you will see a little lightning bolt on the bar. Until that point all XP you earn is gets a 3.75 multiplier and will slowly consume the supercharge state.

You have a bonus to your gained XP if you purchased the Season 10 Battle Pass months ago.

Completing medals for the punchcard allows you to earn 96,000 XP a day.

## Experience Actions Table<a name="actionsa"></a>

*I'm attempting to fill this in with as much accurate information as possible, there may be mistakes and blank spots while I 'research'.*

Each action must be done in a single match, Repeatable actions will give you the XP every time you perform them (such as Search Chest), other actions can only be done once per match (medals and specialist)

## Medals and Medal Punchcard<a name="medalsa"></a>

Each day the Medal Punchcard can be filled in with up to 10 medals. Each medal filled in gives 8,000 XP with the 5th and 10th giving 16,000 XP. Medals can be earned by performing in game feats in a single game.

* First Match of the Day: Play one match to completion (either victory or defeat).
* Survivor Medal: Survive until you are one of the remaining 50/25/10 players. (Battle Royale)
* Scavenger Medal: Open 3/7/12 chests, llama or supply drops.
* Battle Medal: 1/4/8 Eliminations.
* Teamwork Medal: 1/4/8 Assists.
* **NOTE** For Rumble, Battle and Teamwork medals require 2/5/9
* Storm King Medal: Destroy the first horn/second horn/storm king himself. (Storm King LTM)
* Team Score Medal: 50/75/90 Reach this team score in Rumble. (This is inconsistent) (Team Rumble)

You can upgrade each medal earned for more XP within a game, and in some cases you can upgrade medals on the punchard even over more than one game. Once you fill out the medal punchcard, you will only get a small base XP bonus for getting another one. It takes a minimum of 3 matches to fill out the punchcard. The most efficient way is to play a game to open 3 chests, 1 elimination, 1 assist and finish in top 50, then start a new game.

XP for completing the punchcard does not get affected by Supercharged state.

## Fishing Chances

### Fishing Spot

Fishing spots are the white ripples that appear in water, these give a better chance of items when fishing in them. Each spot can have between 3 to 6 items that can be fished out of it, and each item has a chance to appear.

| Item | Chance |
|:-------------:|-------:|
| Flopper | 55.5% |
| Slurpfish | 14.5% |
| Gold Weapon | 1.1% |
| Purple Weapon | 4.4% |
| Blue Weapon | 24.5% |
| Mythic Goldfish | ? |

The Mythic Goldfish is a throwable statue that does 200 damage to targets it hits, it can be rethrown. It's possible but considerably rare to get (I couldn't get one in 1000 tries). The weapon type also has a chance table:

| Type | Chance |
|:------------------------:|-------:|
| Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle | 25.0% |
| Assault Rifle | 12.5% |
| Burst Rifle | 12.5% |
| Tactical Shotgun | 12.5% |
| Pump Shotgun | 12.5% |
| SMG | 12.5% |
| Pistol | 12.5% |

Each weapon comes with respective ammo.

### Open Water

*Still testing*

## Arena Queue Scoring<a name="arenaa"></a>

At the start of Season 1 every player has been reset to 0 hype

### Division Prerequisite

| Hype Needed | Division | Name |
|------------:|----------|------|
| 0 | 1 | Open I |
| 500 | 2 | Open II |
| 1000 | 3 | Open III |
| 1500 | 4 | Open IV |
| 2000 | 5 | Contender I |
| 3000 | 6 | Contender II |
| 4500 | 7 | Contender III |
| 6500 | 8 | Champion I |
| 10000 | 9 | Champion II |
| 14000 | 10 | Champion III |

### Hype Scoring

*Duos have not currently been implemented*  
*Trios are not live currently*

| Solo Prerequisite | Duo Prerequisite | Trio Prerequisite | Squads Prerequisite | Hype Scored |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Victory | Victory | Victory | Victory | 60 |
| Top 5 | Top 3 | Top 2 | Top 2 | 30 |
| Top 15 | Top 7 | Top 4 | Top 3 | 30 |
| Top 25 | Top 12 | Top 8 | Top 6 | 60 |

* You score hype for all placings cumulative, so a Victory will always be 180 hype.

| Size | Hype for Elimination |
|-------|---------------------:|
| Solo | 20 |
| Duos | 10 |
| Trios | 7 |
| Squads | 5 |

### Bus Fare

Bus Fares have been standardised for Season X

| Division | Bus Fare Solo | Bus Fare Trios |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| 1-2 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | -10 | -10 |
| 4 | -20 | -20 |
| 5 | -40 | -40 |
| 6 | -40 | -40 |
| 7 | -50 | -50 |
| 8 | -60 | -60 |
| 9 | -70 | -70 |
| 10 | -80 | -80 |

### How hard is the grind?

Assuming a player could consistently score 80 Hype in every arena game, (equivalent to Top 25 and 1 elimination) how much games would that player need to progress to the next division?

| Progression to Division: | Games Needed |
|:------------------------:|-------------:|
| 2 | 7 |
| 3 | 7 |
| 4 | 8 |
| 5 | 9 |
| 6 | 25 |
| 7 | 38 |
| 8 | 67 |
| 9 | 175 |
| 10 | 400 |

## Fall Damage<a name="falla"></a>

You will start taking fall damage when dropping from a distance of at least 13 meters. The smallest amount of fall damage you will take is 10 damage. This scales up to be lethal at 24 meters. The damage is NOT linear.

| Height in meters | Height in tiles | Damage Taken |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 13 | 3.25 | 10 |
| 16 | 4 | 25 |
| 18 | 4.5 | 40 |
| 20 | 5 | 60 |
| 24 | 6 | 100 |

## Storm Circles<a name="storma"></a>

These numbers are taken from a normal Solo game. Different modes, such as Blitz and Arena, may have different values and behaviors.

| Storm Circle Number | DPS | Radius | Still Time | Close Time | Storm Surge Push |
|:-------------------:|----:|-------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------------:|
| 0 | 0 | 2600m | Varies | Varies | Doesn't |
| 1 | 1 | 800m | 3:20 | 3:00 | 60 |
| 2 | 1 | 400m | 2:00 | 2:00 | 44 |
| 3 | 2 | 200m | 1:30 | 1:30 | 30 |
| 4 | 5 | 100m | 1:20 | 1:10 | 20 |
| 5 | 7.5 | 50m | 0:50 | 1:00 | 16 |
| 6 | 10 | 25m | 0:30 | 1:00 | 14 |
| 7 | 10 | 12.5m | None | 0:55 | 12 |
| 8 | 10 | 10m | None | 0:45 | 6 |
| 9 | 10 | 0m | None | 1:15 | 2 |

Storm Circle Number: When a game starts, the game keeps count of the storm number that it currently is. Starting at 0 when the bus deploys over the island, going up to 1 when the bus has left and going up by 1 once that circle fully closes.  
DPS: The amount of damage the storm does to your health per second if you are in that storm.  
Radius: The radius length of the storm circle once it has finished closing. (The distance from the edge of the new circle to the centre)  
Still Time: The grace period and warning time before the storm starts to close in to the target. If there is None, the storm will start closing immediately.  
Close Time: The amount of time the Storm takes to close in to the new circle once the Still Time has ended.  
Storm Surge Push: If there are at least this many players once that storm has *finished* closing, a storm surge will activate doing damage to the players that have dealt the least amount of player damage. (I'm trying to get the exact numbers for Storm Surge, but I believe it's 20 Damage to your health every 5 seconds). Storm Surge does NOT activate in Normal games, only in Arena.

In Arena, Storms 5 and higher move direction rather than just shrink in on themselves.
